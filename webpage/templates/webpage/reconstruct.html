    <h1>RECONSTRUCTING TD</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to reconstructions </h2>
    <p>
    The main motivation for the visualisation of the finds of the TD F/I palace is to share and disseminate the current state of knowledge of existing and reconstructed architectural structures and their interpretation. In order to reach a wider public, it was decided to choose a format suitable for the presentation over the internet, which also allows a presentation of the final content on mobile devices as well as cinematic formats providing image sequences which could be used on and offline. So-called ‘3D Real-time Environments’ and ‘walk–through’ allow users to interact with a 3D environment to discover the reconstructed site on their own pace studying the included archaeological information and experiencing architectural spaces from a first-person view.

            <p>This scan shows a wooden model of the palace of area F/I, which was produced for the exhibition “Pharaonen und Fremde” at the Vienna city hall in 1994. The model is based on the field documentation of this building, which was excavated between 1979 and 1989. It shows the palace of area F/I in its final stage, just before this building was abandoned.
            To the south of this palace were gardens, in which the elite of this area buried their dead. These were laid to rest in mud-brick constructed tombs, which were arranged in parallels rows. In the entrance areas of the major tombs donkeys were buried in pairs. While in a small distance from the tombs, clearly belonging to these, trees were planted in rows.
            To the west of the palace, outside of its enclosure wall a vineyard with an irrigation system was discovered. Subterranean water pipelines made of burnt bricks brought the water from the Nile to the garden.
            </p>
            <p>
            This model was the starting point for the up-to-date 3D reconstruction of the palace done in the “A puzzle in 4D” project. The latter shows some minor changes, which are based on a very detailed reinvestigation of the architectural remains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 3D model was created from a series of overlapping photographs using Agisoft Professional (version 1.3.3) software for image-based modelling. Afterwards the model has been uploaded to the Sketchfab online service where it is available to the public. Additionally, special interest points of the model were annotated with further information.

          <p>This short film leads you through the reconstruction of a large palace-like building that was excavated by the Austrian Archaeological Institute (ÖAI) during the years 1979 till 1989. This reconstruction is based on the field documentation and the finds retrieved from the building. Since only the foundations, floors and a few courses of the walls were preserved from this palace, for the non-preserved parts used in this reconstruction other documentation of Middle Kingdom architecture were used such as wooden house models, preserved architectural element from other excavations as well as wall paintings and reliefs.
