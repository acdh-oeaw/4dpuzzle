    <h1>Reconstructing Tell el-Daba</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to reconstructions </h2>
    <p>
    The main motivation for the visualisation of the finds of the TD F/I palace is to share and disseminate the current state of knowledge of existing and reconstructed architectural structures and their interpretation. In order to reach a wider public, it was decided to choose a format suitable for the presentation over the internet, which also allows a presentation of the final content on mobile devices as well as cinematic formats providing image sequences which could be used on and offline. So-called ‘3D Real-time Environments’ and ‘walk–through’ allow users to interact with a 3D environment to discover the reconstructed site on their own pace studying the included archaeological information and experiencing architectural spaces from a first-person view.

          Two tombs and a cellar have been reconstructed using field drawings, protocols and photos. Each reconstruction shows the field documentation, a reconstruction of the in situ evidence (i.e. how it looked like when found at excavation) and an idealised reconstruction (how it may originally have looked like).

        <p>This scan shows a wooden model of the palace of area F/I, which was produced for the exhibition “Pharaonen und Fremde” at the Vienna city hall in 1994. The model is based on the field documentation of this building, which was excavated between 1979 and 1989. It shows the palace of area F/I in its final stage, just before this building was abandoned.
