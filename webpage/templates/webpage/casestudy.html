          The archaeological evidence in area F/I dates to the period from the first half of the 15th Dynasty (1650/40‒1530 BC) to the late 12th Dynasty (1980/70‒1800/1790 BC). In the uppermost levels of the area a temple was found which belongs to stratum a/2 (first half of the 15th Dynasty). Underneath the temple, a villa was found, which belongs to  stratum b (middle of the 13th to the end of the 12th Dynasty). Different phases of usage of the villa were identified and therefore the villa stratum b is subdivided into b/3 to b/1. In stratum b offering pits have been documented too.  At a deeper level, the remains of a huge building, most likely a palace or a villa (stratum c; beginning of the 13th to the end of the 12th Dynasty) were found. Finally, the main palace of stratum d/1 (early 13th to late 12th Dynasty) was found underneath . Like the younger villa also for this building showed two phases of usage (phases d/1.1 and d/1.2) and tombs were recoverd as part of it too.  An earlier level showed the Mittelsaalhaus which belonged to stratum d/2 (early 13th to late 12th Dynasty). The Mittelsaalhaus was build on top of the earlier workmen village  of stratum e, dating to the 12th Dynasty. The strata are connected to Tell el-Daba Phases E/2 to N/1-3 . The sequence of the archaeological sequence and strata in relation to the archaeological phases was the basis for the analysis. (<b>Table 1</b>)
          For a detailed analysis square trench j/21 was chosen because it shows evidence of many different types of archaeological features and structures. The dataset was later extended with evidence from 40 additional squares in area F/I. The data included documentation of the palace and surrounding infrastructure of strata d/1were. The following types of documentation were integrated in the GIS for analysis: photographs, slides, field drawings (cross sections, levels, details), field protocols, overview maps, topographical maps); AutoCAD plans, satellite images, topographical data).
