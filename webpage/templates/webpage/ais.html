            Stratigraphy is the analysis and description of events (a sequence of deposition and removal of material) that form archaeological evidence. It forms the basis for all interpretation of archaeological evidence. To analyse the complex stratigraphy at Tell el-Daba an Archaeological Information System (AIS) was created by project partner LBI ArchPro. The AIS consists of a Geographical Information System (GIS) that is connected with a tool to analyse the stratigraphic sequence (Harris Matrix Composer+). This means that a tool for spatial analysis AND temporal analysis has been created, allowing analysis of the complex evidence at Tell el-Daba in four dimensions – Tell el Daba 4D. In A Puzzle in 4D an add-on to connect the GIS with the stratigraphic sequencer has been developed. The Harris Matrix Composer+ has developed, which includes the possibility to enter levels of confidence about stratigraphic relationships and the possibility to group stratigraphic units according to time intervals has been developed too.

            To test the AIS one area of Tell el Daba (F/I) which contains the remains of a palace has been analysed. You can access the 2-dimensional GIS project that was created and explore the archaeological evidence of an Egyptian palace (2D ArcGIS online). In this movie you can see the AIS in action, i.e. how the GIS works with the stratigraphic sequencer (<a href="{% url 'webpage:staticpage' template='hmc' %}">HMC+ movie</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
          In a next step, the archaeological features have been reconstructed in a 3-dimensional GIS to test hypotheses of archaeological interpretation (3D ArcGIS online).

            The GIS projects have been the basis for some more elaborate reconstructions of area F/I, which you can access here (<a href="{% url 'webpage:staticpage' template='reconstruct' %}">Reconstructions</a>).

            <h3>The Tell el-Daba Archaeological Information System (AIS)</h3>

          <p>
            The development of a GIS-based 4D AIS secures comparability of the TD legacy datasets in accordance with stratigraphic theory and methodology, a task, mainly undertaken by the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology (LBI ArchPro).
          </p>
          <p>
            The possibility of reconstructing undocumented and missing information has been examined according to a procedure best described as “reverse excavating”. In reconstructing the workflow of the original excavation and translating it into a stratigraphic sequence datasets can be completed and the reliability of given datasets evaluated. The AIS enhances and simplifies further archaeological interpretation. Respective results will be reproducible in respect to the confirmability of the origin of the archaeological information.

            The first step within a comprehensive digitization process is to transfer the various data sources, i.e. photographs, maps, sketches, lists, notebooks etc. into appropriate digital formats for further use in the GIS-based archaeological information system (AIS) has been described in WP2. The extraction of the relevant stratigraphic units (SU) from analogue or digitized excavation maps is based on digitizing archaeological entities known as stratigraphic units using basic GIS functionality. Every stratigraphic unit (i.e. deposits and surfaces; Neubauer 2007; Traxler – Neubauer 2008) is characterized by its geographic position and extent. Surfaces are defined by their immaterial topography whereas deposits bear material components (artefacts, composition, texture etc.). This sequence has to be refined based on the temporal relations of all units. Since every archaeological entity could be defined temporally as a time span or time interval rather than a point in time or event, a temporal analysis of the dataset has to be carried out based on time intervals, advancing the event-based concept of simple temporal relations (earlier, later, contemporary). For this reason interval algebra as suggested by Allen (1986) has to be introduced as also recently shown by Drap et al (2017). As archaeological stratigraphy is based on 4D entities, it deals first of all with the analysis of spatio-temporal relations of archaeological stratigraphic units to derive the formation of the respective stratification. Only spatio-temporal analysis is capable of illustrating the changes of an archaeological site or landscape. For defining temporal relation a physical superposition (i.e. the entities have not to be in direct physical contact) of SU is not necessary. This approach is similar to the monitoring of various processes, which change the attributes and/or the shape of volumes in time (e.g. earth slides, flooding and mining; Kurte – Durbha 2016).

          <h3>GIS-based Archaeological Information System (AIS)</h3>
          <p>
            The main focus of the research and development done by the LBI ArchPro was the design and implementation of the different components of a GIS-based AIS. Because of the geographical character of archaeological excavation information the appropriate frame is provided by a GIS. Based on the LBI ArchPro’s long-term experience of the application of ArcGIS (ESRI) for the interpretation and analysis of archaeological data, ArcGIS Desktop 10.2 was chosen (also in respect for basic compatibility with other software, which can be included also as an extension). In contrary to CAD software a GIS is also capable of dealing with various types of information (e.g. information based on raster datasets, feature classes but also textual information). It is the most appropriate environment to segment space and correlate the generated areas or volumes with the embedded archaeological information.  A GIS provides an enormous set of different spatial analysis and data query tools. It is perfectly suited to analyse and display the spatial superposition of archaeological entities. For the digitization and interpretation of 2D based information (e.g. drawings, photographs and maps) ArcMAP 10.2 was used, whereas for the 3D visualization ArcSCENE 10.2 proofed to be perfectly suited for the TD dataset. Although initially a separate 3D viewer had been developed on the basis of true 3D, the 2.5D representation capabilities of ArcSCENE were sufficient. As the 3D objects were derived from a few cross-sections and level drawings, the reconstructed geometry was very simple and a real 3D viewer not necessary. In contrary datasets based on recent 3D data capturing techniques (e.g. Image Based Modelling (Doneus et al. 2011) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (Neubauer 2007; Doneus – Neubauer 2005)) bear more complex 3D geometry.  A voxel based approach for the archaeological biased segmentation of space and further temporal analysis of geospatial processes is preferable (Jjumba – Dragićević 2016).
