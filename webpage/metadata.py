    'description': 'Since 1966, Austrian excavations took place at Tell el-Daba (TD) in Egypt, an archaeological site revealing evidence from a society with contacts to many parts of the eastern Mediterranean dating to the 12th to 18th dynasties (early second millennium BC). After 50 years of fieldwork campaigns, the TD archive at OREA (Austrian Academy of Sciences) contains a huge and heterogeneous resource of digital and non-digital photographs, plans, drawings and written documentation.',
